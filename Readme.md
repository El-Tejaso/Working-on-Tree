# Working tree (Try it [here](https://el-tejaso.github.io/Working-on-Tree/NoteTree.html))

A lot of the time, I find myself doing things like this in notepad:

```
- [x] task1
- [x] task2
- [...] task3 big one
    - [...] subtask
        - [...] working...
```

It helps me see where I am at, and if I get distracted for whatever reason, I can just come back to this to see where I left off. 
It is more useful when programming, or other creative things where it is hard to see progress just by looking at what you have.

This web-app is a way to automate that particular note-taking structure, and adds some extra features to measure time usage.
